    <h2>CO2 emissions falling in Wales since 2011</h2>
    <p>The Earth is warming up,and Wales is too. The summer of 2018 hit high temperature records in the country, with the sunniest June since 1975.</p>

    <p>Besides the pleasant experience of sunbathing, this change in weather patterns has prompted concerns on climate change and how it can have an impact on public health and economy.</p>

    <p>Despite scientists differing opinions on whether the current global wave of hot temperatures is caused by climate change, all agree that future heat waves will be more frequent and hotter due to carbon emissions.</p>

    <p>The Paris Agreement on climate change set a target of staying within 2°C of warming, but new measures should be implemented to tackle polluting emissions swiftly and sharply. Is Wales doing its work?</p>

    <p>The latest data from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has revealed that the country cut by 8% its carbon emissions from 2011 to 2016.</p>

    <p>In 2016, Wales sent to the atmosphere 19,603 kilotonnes (kt) of CO₂, down from 21,322 five years earlier. One kilotonne equals to 1,000 tonnes.</p>

    <p>The heatwave that slammed Britain over the last week has raised the awareness about the growing risks of climate change.</p>

    <p>The biggest chunk of these emissions, about 56.5% of the total, stemmed from industrial and commercial activities, which sent 14,055 kt of COâ to the atmosphere.</p>

    <p>The Carbon footprint of this sector in Wales was 11.5% lower than in 2011, thanks to a decrease in the use of coal for electricity generation.</p>

    <p>The Domestic sector was responsible for 56.5% of the carbon dioxide released in 2016.</p>

    <p>Its Carbon impact was 11.5% lower than in 2011.</p>

    <p>Transport accounted for 25.7% of the overall emissions, 4.2% higher than in 2011.</p>

    <p>The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy also takes into account the amount of CO₂ taken out of the air by the woodland.</p>

    <p>According to its estimates, forests got rid of 3% of the carbon emissions caused by human activities in 2016.</p>

    <h3>Trees and plants, an ally saving the NHS millions in Wales</h3>

    <p>Pollution is not only worrying regarding global warming - it also threatens public health. Besides increasing its budgets in green policies, Governments all around the world have an ally in forests and plants to address this problem.</p>

    <p>A recent study carried out by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed that trees and plants in Wales are helping the NHS to save millions of pounds by removing air pollution.</p>

    <p>A study for the Office for National Statistics (ONS) reveals that in 2015 the NHS avoided £55.2 million in health costs thanks to air quality improvements by natural vegetation. That's £15.12 for every resident.</p>

    <p>In the whole UK, the ONS estimates there were 7,100 fewer lung and heart-related hospital admissions, 27,000 fewer life years lost and 1,900 fewer premature deaths thanks to the service provided by nature. The saving for the whole of the UK was £1 billion.</p>

    <p>Woodlands, grasslands and shrubs in Wales absorbed 118.3 tonnes of air pollutants - about 58 kg of contaminants per hectare.</p>

    <div id="row">

    <br><br><p>The most harmful of these substances is PM2.5, small particles with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometres - about 3% of the diameter of a human hair. These particles can trigger chronic diseases such as asthma, heart disease, bronchitis, and cause other respiratory problems.</p>

    <p>The data also includes PM10, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ground-level ozone and ammonia.</p>

    <p>In Wales, ozone was the pollutant most absorbed by plants, making up about 81% of the total.</p>

    <p>According to the ONS, trees account for the highest volume of air pollutants removed by vegetation.</p>

    <p>Overall, the study shows that 1.4 billion kg of harmful substances were taken out by vegetation in the UK in 2015.</p>

    <p>Professor Paul Cosford, Medical Director and Director of Health Protection at Public Health England, said:</p>

    <p>"Air pollution is a growing threat to the public’s health, evidence shows it has a strong causal association with coronary heart disease, stroke, lung cancer and childhood asthma."</p>

    <p>Karen Exley, Head of Public Health England’s air quality and public health group, added:</p>

    <p>“Long-term exposure to particulate matter is known to be a contributory factor in early deaths, particularly for people with cardiovascular and respiratory disease, and is estimated to have an effect equivalent to 29,000 deaths a year in the UK.</p>

    <p>“Long-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide is also thought to contribute to early deaths although its effects have yet to be quantified.”</p>

    <p>A study published by the British Heart Foundation last week links levels of air pollution well below the UK’s current legal limits with serious changes in the heart structure.</p>

    <p>Simon Gillespie, Chief Executive at the British Heart Foundation, said:</p>

    <p>"Although the increase in heart chamber size is small in this study, it is an early warning sign, which may explain the increased risk of heart failure in individuals exposed to higher level of pollution.</p>

    <p>“We urge the Government to adopt the more stringent World Health Organization air quality guidelines."</p>
