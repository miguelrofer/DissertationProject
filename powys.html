  <h2>CO2 emissions falling in Powys since 2011</h2>
  <p>Powys is one of the councils contributing most to curb climate change in Wales, official figures show.</p>

  <p>Latest data from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has revealed that this local authority cut by 5.2% its carbon emissions from 2011 to 2016.</p>

  <p>In 2016, Powys sent to the atmosphere 741 kilotonnes (kt) of CO₂, down from 781 five years earlier. One kilotonne equals to 1,000 tonnes.</p>

  <p>The heatwave that slammed Britain over the last week has raised the awareness about the growing risks of climate change.

  <p>Despite scientists differ on whether the current global wave of hot temperatures is caused by climate change, all agree that future heatwaves will be more frequent and hotter due to carbon emissions.

  <p>The biggest chunk of these emissions, about 35.8% of the total, stemmed from transport, which sent 349 kt of CO2 to the atmosphere. That includes freight and passenger transport, both private and for business purposes.

  <p>The Carbon footprint of this sector in Powys was 0.7% higher than five years earlier.</p>

  <p>Industrial and commercial activities were responsible for 35.4% of the carbon dioxide released in 2016.</p>

  <p>Its Carbon impact was 16.8% lower than five years earlier, thanks to a decrease in the use of coal for electricity generation.</p>

  <p>Lower Coal consumption helped to curb the impact of the domestic sector too, despite it accounted for 28.8% of the emissions in 2016.</p>

  <p>The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy also takes into account the amount of CO₂ taken out of the air by the woodland.According to its estimates, forests got rid of 24.1% of the carbon emissions caused by human activities in 2016.</p>

  <p>Gareth Redmond-King, head of climate change at the World Wildlife Fund UK, put the increase in emissions from transport down to the greater number of large cars on British roads.</p>

  <p>He said: "We’re aping the American market and more drivers are switching to unnecessarily large vehicles with greater carbon emissions. Bigger vehicles tend to be less efficient on fuel use.</p>

  <p>Jason Torrance, a transport expert at UK100, a network of local governments committed to promoting clean energy, called on the Government to take urgent action to tackle transport emissions.</p>

  <p>He said: "It is expected that the Government will want to give local authorities more powers to tackle air pollution in the environment legislation next year. But without significant shifts on things like electrification of railway lines, cleaner buses and taxis, plus a shift away from car dependency by designing our cities better, this trend will only get worse."</p>

<h3>Trees and plants, an ally saving the NHS millions in Powys</h3>

<p>Trees and plants in Powys are helping the NHS to save millions of pounds by removing air pollution.</p>

<p>A study for the Office for National Statistics (ONS) reveals that in 2015 the NHS avoided £2.1 million in health costs thanks to air quality improvements by natural vegetation. That's £15.89 for every resident.</p>

<p>Nationally, the ONS estimates there were 7,100 fewer lung and heart-related hospital admissions, 27,000 fewer life years lost and 1,900 fewer premature deaths thanks to the service provided by nature. The saving for the whole of the UK was £1 billion.</p>

<p>Woodlands, grasslands and shrubs in Powys absorbed 30.7 tonnes of air pollutants - about 59 kg of contaminants per hectare.</p>

<div id="row">

<p>The most harmful of these substances is PM2.5, small particles with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometres - about 3% of the diameter of a human hair. These particles can trigger chronic disease such as asthma, heart disease, bronchitis, and cause other respiratory problems</p>

<p>The data also includes PM10, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ground-level ozone and ammonia.</p>

<p>In Powys, ozone was the pollutant most absorbed by plants, making up about 83% of the total.</p>

<p>According to the ONS, trees account for the highest volume of air pollutants removed by vegetation.</p>

<p>Overall, the study shows that 1.4 billion kg of harmful substances were taken out by vegetation in the UK in 2015.</p>

<p>Professor Paul Cosford, Medical Director and Director of Health Protection at Public Health England, said:</p>

<p>"Air pollution is a growing threat to the public’s health, evidence shows it has a strong causal association with coronary heart disease, stroke, lung cancer and childhood asthma."</p>

<p>Karen Exley, Head of Public Health England’s air quality and public health group, added:</p>

<p>“Long-term exposure to particulate matter is known to be a contributory factor in early deaths, particularly for people with cardiovascular and respiratory disease, and is estimated to have an effect equivalent to 29,000 deaths a year in the UK.</p>

<p>“Long-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide is also thought to contribute to early deaths although its effects have yet to be quantified.”</p>

<p>A study published by the British Heart Foundation last week links levels of air pollution well below the UK’s current legal limits with serious changes in the heart structure.</p>

<p>Simon Gillespie, Chief Executive at the British Heart Foundation, said:</p>

<p>"Although the increase in heart chamber size is small in this study, it is an early warning sign, which may explain the increased risk of heart failure in individuals exposed to higher level of pollution.</p>

<p>“We urge the Government to adopt the more stringent World Health Organization air quality guidelines."</p>

<p>The health and social care costs of air pollution in England could reach £18.6 billion by 2035 unless action is taken, according to Public Health England.</p>

<p>Last year, the cost was estimated to be £157 million.</p>
